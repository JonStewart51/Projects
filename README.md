Projects and Academic Assignments

This contains a few academic and small, non-directly work related projects. The most interesting one is the Causality Analysis and Variable Importance measure report. The machine learning project I notebook gives a good overview of a few machine learning concepts. The others show some basic data mining and statistical modeling techniques. Occasionally, the ipython notebooks do not render. Try downloading the notebooks or using  "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/", and it usually formats it correctly.
