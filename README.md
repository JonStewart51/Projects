Projects and Academic Assignments

This contains a few academic and small, non-directly work related projects. The most interesting one is the Causality Analysis and Variable Importance measure report. The machine learning project I notebook gives a good overview of a few machine learning concepts. The others show some basic data mining and statistical modeling techniques.
